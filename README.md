# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###Project Details and Report . 

VideoPlayer:

VideoPlayer.js: Contains the video player component with functionalities such as Play/Pause toggle, Seek functionality, Timer, Autoplay, and Speed selector.
Playlist:

Playlist.js: Manages the playlist component, where you can list the videos. If needed, you can also create PlaylistItem.js to represent each item in the playlist.
Context:


VideoContext:
VideoContext.js: Manages the state and provides context for the video-related functionalities such as current video index, isPlaying, currentTime, duration, playbackSpeed, etc.

App.js:
App.js: The main component that wraps the entire application, providing the context to child components.
Additional Notes:

The project uses React context to manage the state and pass down the necessary information to the components.
I have used CSS3 and Material UI Icons for styling the components.
Autoplay functionality can be implemented using the autoPlay attribute in the VideoPlayer.js component.
For speed selection, you can provide a dropdown or button to adjust playback speed, and update it using the setPlaybackSpeed function in the context.
Remember to handle the implementation details, like integrating a video player library or directly using HTML5 <video> tag, setting up event listeners for time updates, and connecting everything through the VideoContext.
